# 🗂️ Mini-Project Portfolio  
_A collection of bite-sized, self-contained projects completed during my Generation Data Analytics boot camp._

Each module of the programme introduced a new tool or language; every time, I wrapped up the learning with a focused project that put the concepts into practice.  
Below is a quick tour—what the task was, what I produced, and a link to the finished work.

## 1 Excel • Interactive Dashboard  
**Project:** **Avocado Sales Analysis**  
**Objective:** Clean, explore and visualise weekly avocado-sales data for the US market.

| What I did | Skills demonstrated |
|------------|--------------------|
| ▪ Data cleaning & type fixes in Power Query | ✅ Data wrangling in Excel/Power Query |
| ▪ Built DAX measures for YoY % change | ✅ Pivot Tables & DAX |
| ▪ Designed a slicer-driven dashboard (region, avocado type, date) | ✅ Dashboard layout & KPI cards |
| ▪ Recommended pricing & supply moves based on regional demand | ✅ Storytelling with data |

## 2 SQL • Structure Data Analytics  
**Project:** **Global Population Analysis**  
**Objective:** Write repeatable SQL routines for a mock Kenyan government brief on worldwide population shifts.

| What I did | Skills demonstrated |
|------------|--------------------|
| ▪ Re-modelled a schema issue (`INTEGER` → `FLOAT`) to keep decimal precision | ✅ Database design & refactoring |
| ▪ Created parameterised queries: smallest population, Africa total 2010, Europe CAGR, etc. | ✅ Joins, aggregates, window functions |
| ▪ Produced a README with business-ready tables & interpretations | ✅ Translating SQL output into insights |
| ▪ Added extra “bonus” queries (top growers, Kenya’s rank, world shares) | ✅ Initiative & domain reasoning |

## 3 Python + Pandas • Exploratory Data Analysis

**Project:** **Titanic Survival Study**
**Objective:** Use Python, Pandas and Seaborn to uncover the demographic and socio‑economic patterns behind who lived and who didn’t.

| What I did                                                                                                                    | Skills demonstrated                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ▪ Cleaned & filtered the classic `titanic3.csv` dataset (handling `NaN`s, relabelling categories)                             | ✅ Data wrangling in Pandas                   |
| ▪ Calculated headline metrics (average age of survivors, survival % by gender & class)                                        | ✅ Descriptive statistics                     |
| ▪ Built seven publication‑quality visuals—bar, box and scatter plots—that layer up to five variables at once                  | ✅ Data visualisation with Matplotlib/Seaborn |
| ▪ Interpreted findings for a non‑technical audience | ✅ Insight communication & storytelling       |
