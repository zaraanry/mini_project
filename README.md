# Mini-Project Portfolio  
_A collection of bite-sized, self-contained projects completed during my Generation Data Analytics boot camp._

Each module of the programme introduced a new tool or language; every time, I wrapped up the learning with a focused project that put the concepts into practice.  
Below is a quick tour; what the task was, what I produced, and a link to the finished work.

## 1 Excel • Interactive Dashboard  
**Project:** **Avocado Sales Analysis**  
**Objective:** Clean, explore and visualise weekly avocado-sales data for the US market.

| What I did | Skills demonstrated |
|------------|--------------------|
| Data cleaning & type fixes in Power Query | Data wrangling in Excel/Power Query |
| Built DAX measures for YoY % change | Pivot Tables & DAX |
| Designed a slicer-driven dashboard (region, avocado type, date) | Dashboard layout & KPI cards |
| Recommended pricing & supply moves based on regional demand | Storytelling with data |

## 2 SQL • Structure Data Analytics  
**Project:** **Global Population Analysis**  
**Objective:** Write repeatable SQL routines for a mock Kenyan government brief on worldwide population shifts.

| What I did | Skills demonstrated |
|------------|--------------------|
| Re-modelled a schema issue (`INTEGER` → `FLOAT`) to keep decimal precision | Database design & refactoring |
| Created parameterised queries: smallest population, Africa total 2010, Europe CAGR, etc. | Joins, aggregates, window functions |
| Produced a README with business-ready tables & interpretations | Translating SQL output into insights |
| Added extra “bonus” queries (top growers, Kenya’s rank, world shares) | Initiative & domain reasoning |

## 3 Python + Pandas • Exploratory Data Analysis

**Project:** **Titanic Survival Study**
**Objective:** Use Python, Pandas and Seaborn to uncover the demographic and socio‑economic patterns behind who lived and who didn’t.

| What I did                                                                                                                    | Skills demonstrated                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Cleaned & filtered the classic `titanic3.csv` dataset (handling `NaN`s, relabelling categories)                             | Data wrangling in Pandas                   |
| Calculated headline metrics (average age of survivors, survival % by gender & class)                                        | Descriptive statistics                     |
| Built seven publication‑quality visuals; bar, box and scatter plots, that layer up to five variables at once                  | Data visualisation with Matplotlib/Seaborn |
| Interpreted findings for a non‑technical audience | Insight communication & storytelling       |

## 4. SQL + Python – AdventureWorks2019 Interim Project
**Project:** **Adventure Works 2019 Data Analytics Report**  
**Objective:** Answer six business questions (regional sales, leave vs bonus, country revenue, sick‑leave patterns, trading duration vs revenue, and store size/staffing vs revenue) using T‑SQL for extraction and Python for analysis/visuals; delivered as a 42‑page report and 15‑slide executive deck (completed 17 July 2025, presented 21 July 2025).

| What I did | Skills demonstrated |
|------------|--------------------|
| Built CTE‑driven T‑SQL pipelines across Sales, Person & HR; parsed XML store demographics (size & employees) | Advanced SQL (CTEs, joins, XML shredding) |
| Quantified relationships (Pearson r, OLS trend) and normalised metrics (per‑customer / per‑employee) | Statistics & feature engineering |
| Produced executive visuals (bar & choropleth, scatter + regression with CI, heat‑map, pair‑plot, 3‑D scatter) | Visualisation & storytelling |
| Turned analytics into actions (marketing focus, store audits, wellness initiatives) | Business insight & prioritisation |

**Key results:**
- **US revenue concentration:** California, Washington & Texas together contribute 55% of total US sales; prime targets for incremental spend.  
- **Leave vs bonus:** No meaningful correlation between vacation hours and sales bonus (r = −0.041, n = 17).  
- **Country mix:** Australia ranks 3rd on total revenue but last on revenue per customer; USA + Canada = 72.5% of global revenue.  
- **Store maturity:** Trading duration shows a moderate positive link to revenue (r = 0.41, 635 stores); top earners are 32-34-month locations, with some 8–22‑month stores already above $0.10 M.  
- **Size & staffing:** Store size and headcount are tightly coupled (r = 0.97) but both are weakly related to revenue; average revenue $192k (large), $172k (small) vs $53k (medium), medium stores need optimisation.  
- **Sick‑leave patterns:** Production’s scale drives the highest total sick‑leave; Shipping & Receiving posts the highest average (67 h) vs Engineering (29 h). Corporate staff generate 95.6% of total hours (more people), night shift has the highest average; day shift holds 60.8% of total due to size.
